    <h1 id="start">So I did an externship over spring break with David
    Leppik, an alum of Grinnell College who works at Vocal Labs in Minneapolis.</h1>
<p> He was a Computer Science major
    back when CS was also part of the math department. We worked on this
    cool project using an O L A P database in javascript loaded in as a
    jay son to access a huge amount of data really quickly. I've linked to it
    below! The thing with the graphic below is that the actual data
    visualization of it is pretty shoddy and not at all the point and
    something we threw together in about ten minutes at 6 PM on Friday
    night..the thing that was really cool is the fact that at the top you
    can filter through the entire dataset recursively by whatever you'd
    like. Also, the code is not at all specific to the dataset at all so
    for whatever you give it those filters will work. (And produce a very
    very shoddy visualization.) </p>

<p>The visualization itself uses D Three a javascript library that is really
  great for creating data visualizations for how it communications with the
  domme. </p>

<p>But anyways I suck and this is all I have this week to offer anyone to be
  quite honest about anything so here's the link:

<p>You can see all the cool database stuff on git hub at:

<p><small>My apologies if anything in here is worded bad, I'm using a speech to text
  type thing and then putting in links. (I knew it would get externship
  wrong, that one I hand corrected)
